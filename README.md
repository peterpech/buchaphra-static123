# Buchaphra NFT Auth Example

This project demonstrates a simple authentication flow using **Next.js**, **NextAuth** and a file-based user store.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/login` to sign in. You can create a new account at `/signup`.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

The project is ready to deploy to Vercel.

### Assets

Binary image files are not included in this repository. The site uses a small
`favicon.svg` under `app/public/`. Replace this file with your own SVG if you
need a custom icon.
